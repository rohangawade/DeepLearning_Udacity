# DeepLearning_Udacity
Using notMnist [A-J letter] Dataset and develop deep neural network models.
<li>Develop Logistic Regression Classifier to predict the character in the image.
<li>Develop Deep Neural Network models using Logistic Classifier and Stocastic Gradient Descent with 1 hidden layer, 5-hidden layer.
<li>Calculated the accuracy on train, validation and test set with and without regularization.
Implemented l2 regularization, dropout to prevent overfitting.
