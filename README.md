# DeepLearning_Udacity
Using notMnist Dataset and develop deep neural network models
Develop Deep Neural Network models using tensorflow with 1 hidden layer, 5-hidden layer.
Calculated the accuracy on train, validation and test set with and without regularization.
Implemented l2 regularization, dropout to prevent overfitting.
